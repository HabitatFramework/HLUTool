--------
Overview
--------
The HLU Tool provides a user interface for maintaining habitat & Land Use
data, including changes to attributes and changes to the spatial data. It also
provides an audit trail to indicate when it was edited, why and by whom.

The tool provides an interface that links the spatial and attribute data in
multiple software environments - it can link ArcGIS or MapInfo applications
with databases held in Access or SQL Server, and in principle it could link to
other database systems such as PostgreSQL and Oracle but these have not been
tested.

Features
--------
 - The HLU Tool provides the following features:
 - Ensures that all attributes selected by users are valid and compatible
 - Improved data retrieval/update response times over single GIS layers
 - Maintains a brief history of all changes made to every habitat polygon
 - Stores the data in a relational structure to reduce GIS data volumes
 - Enables queries to be produced for a range of purposes using the
		relational database
 - Enables data to be extracted according to user requirements
 - Standardises the format of habitat data enabling local, regional or
		national datasets to be combined

Requirements
------------
The HLU Tool requires the following:
 - Microsoft Windows 10 or Windows 11
 - 3 GHz or higher processor
 - 4 GB RAM
 - 3 GB of free hard disk space
      (For increased performance a multiple core processor with as much RAM
		as possible is recommended)

 - Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8.1 or later installed

 - Microsoft Access 2000 or later, OR
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Express Edition or later, OR
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2016 or later

Installation

run the tool. By default all files are installed in the
"Program Files\HLU\HLU GIS Tool" folder (or
"Program Files (x86)\HLU\HLU GIS Tool" on 64bit versions of Windows).
